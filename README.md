### Description
The team at PUBG has made official game data available for the public to explore and scavenge outside of "The Blue Circle." 
You are given over 65,000 games' worth of anonymized player data, split into training and testing sets, and asked to predict final placement from final in-game stats and initial player ratings.
What's the best strategy to win in PUBG? Should you sit in one spot and hide your way into victory, or do you need to be the top shot? Let's let the data do the talking!

This analysis is focused on:

1. Imbalanced learning: Random Undersampling, CNN, Tomek's Link, Random Oversampling, SMOTE, K-Means SMOTE, ADASYN
2. Anomaly detection: DBSCAN, KNN, LOF, ABOD, Isolation Forest, Extended Isolation Forest, Autoencoders;
3. Advanced classification methods: Naive Bayes, Rule-based classifiers, Logistic Regression, SVM, Ensembles (Random-Forest, Bagging, Adaboost) and Neural 4. Netoworks (MLP);
5. Time series analysis: Motifs & Anomaly detection, Clustering, Shaplet-based classifiers;


### Course Objectives
Mining with big data or big data mining has become an active research area. Running
current analytical methodologies and software tools on a single personal computer
cannot efficiently deal with very large datasets. Distributed computing platforms are
a scalable solution for big data mining, obtained by dividing a large problem into
smaller ones that are concurrently solved by many single processor/machine. This
course aims at teaching the basic theoretical concepts behind the MapReduce distributed computing paradigm, and Hadoop in particular, and at building expertise in
the practical usage of high performance computing tools for data engineering, analysis and mining. In particular the students will learn how the classical data mining
algorithms can be applied on Big Data using Hadoop (Spark). Real (and open source) datasets will be used to present examples and to let the students build their own
projects. Half of the lessons will consists of practice (Lab), and half of lectures.
