### Description
PUBG dataset is composed of over 4,500,000 official game data. This project consists in analyzing players' game statistics, employing different unsupervised and supervised data mining/machine learning algorithms across the PUBG dataset. Spark engine was used to develop the whole project. The main task consists to identify the final placement based on different gaming approaches. The analysis contains:
1. Clustering to identify different playing styles
2. Different basic/advanced classification models such as NN with personalized early stopping, SVM, Logistic Regression, ensemble models,...
3. Explainability module to identify the attributes that most lead to victory

### Course Objectives
Mining with big data or big data mining has become an active research area. Running
current analytical methodologies and software tools on a single personal computer
cannot efficiently deal with very large datasets. Distributed computing platforms are
a scalable solution for big data mining, obtained by dividing a large problem into
smaller ones that are concurrently solved by many single processor/machine. This
course aims at teaching the basic theoretical concepts behind the MapReduce distributed computing paradigm, and Hadoop in particular, and at building expertise in
the practical usage of high performance computing tools for data engineering, analysis and mining. In particular the students will learn how the classical data mining
algorithms can be applied on Big Data using Hadoop (Spark). Real (and open source) datasets will be used to present examples and to let the students build their own
projects. Half of the lessons will consists of practice (Lab), and half of lectures.
